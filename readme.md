## Summary

I created model to predict NFL scoring totals for games. I used data from games from previous seasons to train the model, and I will test the model by games after week 6 of any given season.

## Inspiration

I love sports, I love machine learning, and I love python coding. I have been wanting to do something like this for a long time, but never got going with it. Glad to finally start it.

## Challenges

A week into the event, I got hired. Onboarding has taken up most of my time unfortunately, so I was not able to finish the project, but I will definitely get back to this soon once I have more free time. Also, scraping all the data was very difficult and time consuming.

## Reflections

1. I learned a bit about predictive modeling duringmy research phase.

2. Hopefully next time I can commit more time to the event and complete a build to showcase.
